Changelog for 13/03/2021 (DD/MM/YY) - V 1.1.0 (PYTHON)

**__BUG FIXES:__**
- Fixed issue where BOTrased would mistakenly report creating a "clear" case when you used !nickname

**__NEW COMMANDS:__**
+ Added !randomint, for generating a random integer. Use !randomint followed by 1 or 2 integers to generate a number in a given range

**__COMMAND CHANGES:__**
+ Both !topexp and !topcredit now show the top 100 users in 10 pages
+ Leaderboards are now only updated every 15 minutes to reduce waiting time when calling !topexp or !topcredit (they would otherwise literally take 1 minute and 30 seconds to generate)
+ !info now provides a link to vote for BOTrased on top.gg

**__SILENT CHANGES:__**
+ Tasks will now print statuses in order to allow tracking of task loops
+ BOTrased will now post its server count to the bot sites that it has been added to, and this will update every 30 minutes

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Arabic and other RTL characters will reverse the order of elements on the leaderboard for that entry
