Changelog for XX/XX/XXXX (DD/MM/YYYY) - V 2.0.0 JAVA EDITION

**__FEATURED CHANGES:__**
*Goodbye Python!*
BOTrased is now fully written in JavaScript, and uses the Slash Commands system for all of its commands.
This should work better and allow for BOTrased to be more up to date with newer features whilst taking advantage of them to enhance the experience of using it.


**__BUG FIXES:__**
 + I guess not dying when the new intent is introduced is a bug fix in a kind of way.
- BOTrased will no longer display the author's badges when using another user for an argument with /profile

**__NEW COMMANDS:__**
+ /usersettings added, containing `levelupmessage`, `profilemessage`, `clearprofilemessage`, `show` and `embedcolour`

**__COMMAND CHANGES:__**
- The /weather command has been removed due to the lack of an OpenWeatherMap API wrapper for Node.js
- The prefix command has been removed due to the fact that it is now redundant
- The profile embed will no longer display a default message if none is set
- The profile embed will no longer present my profile in a special colour, rather you should identify me by the developer badge on my profile
- Osu commands have been removed due to low usage
~ Probabilities and ranges for the daily handout have been changed
+ svsettings, now called serversettings, is now a group containing all the different options regarding it.
+ A custom profile colour will now override the default level-dependant colour
- Leaderboards are no longer cached in the background, mimicking old behaviour and providing up to date leaderboards

**__MISC CHANGES:__**
- Users no longer accumulate exp and credits from invoking commands

**__SILENT CHANGES:__**
+ All vulnerable database credentials are now stored as environment variables, increasing security.
+ BOTrased now tracks how many times each command has been used. This is just a counter that increments, I cannot see who has used the command or why.
+ The prefix column has been dropped in the `servers` database table due to deprecation

**__KNOWN ISSUES:__**
- BOTrased is no longer written in Python
- BOTrased will fail to congratulate you on levelling up if messages are sent too quickly
